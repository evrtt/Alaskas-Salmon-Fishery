// 1] Google a way to create state for the wave transitions to keep track of their 
//    animation and be able to plug right into it to either maintain the waves as 
//    they go up and down OR to trigger a big wave to clear the screen and replace
//    its content.
// 
// 2] Change the scroller to give me more control --> 
//    one large item and can see where I'm at in terms of the item at any point
//    OR Have a 5000 tiny divs with height of like 2px and put everything into 
//    scroller callback and know the location, also could have it complete teh scroll
//    of a user to a specific spot
//
// 3] Make put all the geophraphic info together into one thing 
//
// 4] Create geographic containers for each fishing area for intro, 
//    zoom to bounding box and spatial comparison.
//
// 5] Create splash page with title --> need to look at some other data vis for ideas
//    
//    Would be cool if this had a more clear motivation / angle
//       -- ie how much food are we getting from the ocean sustainably 
//        - how many people could be fed with each amount of fish
//        - Need to talk more about history of salmon, 
//          and how salmon could be an endless supply of food if harvested sustainably,
//          and how AK is one of the best fisheries in the world
//    Alaskan Salmon Fishery by the Numbers 1979 - 2020
//    
//    
//    - Blurb about the alaskan salmon fishery and my motivation to create this
//    - Scroll through the five species
//    - 
//
// 6] Need to research each area a bit more to be able to introduce them, Create
//    brief at least geographic introduction to each area upon reaching the geographic 
//    section of the scroller which then opens to zoom to bounding box
//    
//    Create zoom to bounding boxes for each area with Stream graphs for each 
//    location for the duration of the 31 years upon zoom.
//
// 7] Zoom to bounding box then transitions to a statewide comparison 
//
// 8] Need to make the year selection look less janky -- would be cool to have 
//    it look like the apple clock that rolls
//
