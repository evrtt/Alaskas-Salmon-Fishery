            Alaska's salmon fishing industry is one of the world's most
            sustainable fisheries, having managed to produce billions of pounds
            of wildcaught salmon and maintain the worlds largest remaining 
            salmon populations for decades.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-p-2">
            Salmon fishing is a highly unpredictable business due to the 
            natural variations in fish migrations and restrictions imposed by 
            strict fishing management, a challenge made increasingly difficult 
            by climate change.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-p-3">
            Curious about these variations, I created a visualisation of the
            state's data of the annual Salmon catch in pounds from 1979 to 2020. 
            The data is split between eleven different areas and between the five different
            salmon species fished in Alaska.

                  Chinook (King) Salmon usually weigh 10 - 50 pounds in maturity
                  but can weigh up to 126 pounds. They typically measure between
                  24 and 36 inches but can grow to 58 inches inches.
                  Chinook mature in approximately 3 - 8 years. 
                  They spawn (reproduce) early in the summer in large rivers
                  and are typically the earliest salmon to be commercially fished 
                  in Alaska. Chinook are caught in the lowest numbers and are the 
                  most expensive of the five species.Chinook are processed into 
                  fillets that can be quite pricey and are prized for their rich, 
                  fatty flavor.

                  Coho (Silver) Salmon typically weigh 8 - 12 pounds and average 
                  28 inches in length as adults. Coho mature in approximately 
                  4 years and spawn (reproduce) during the late summer and 
                  fall in a variety of lake, river and stream environemnts. 
                  Coho typically are the third most valued of the five species 
                  and produce for fillets, amongth other products.

                  Sockeye (Red) Salmon weigh 5 - 15 pounds and average 24
                  inches in length as adults. Sockeye mature in 4 - 5 years and 
                  spawn in two 'groups', one in early summer the other in late 
                  summer to fall in rivers and streams near lakes. 
                  Newly hatched salmon often stay in lakes for 1 - 2 years 
                  before migrating back to the ocean. Sockeye salmon are the 
                  second most valuable of the five species and usually are processed 
                  into fillets and smoked. They are the caught in the second highest 
                  volumes in Alaska.

                  Chum (Dog) Salmon typically weigh 10 - 20 pounds and average 
                  24 inches in length as adults. They spawn in early to mid-summer
                  in smaller rivers and streams and intertidal zones. 
                  They migrate directly back to the ocean and mature for 3 - 5 years.
                  Chum are the second least valuable of the five species and

                  Pink (Humpy) Salmon typically weigh 4 - 5 pounds and average

                  after maturing for 1 - 2 years. 
                  After hatching they migrate directly to marine or estuarine environments. 
                  Pinks are the least valuable of the five species but are caught 
                  in the highest numbers. They are mostly processed into canned
